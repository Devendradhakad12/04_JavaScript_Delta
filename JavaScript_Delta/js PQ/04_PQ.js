// which missing line would allow you to create five variables (one,two,three,four,five) that correspond to their numericle values (1,2,3,4,5)?

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];


//1. const [one,two,three,four,five] = [numbers]

//2. const [one,two,three,four,five] = numbers // correct

//3. const {one,two,three,four,five} = numbers

//4. const {one,two,three,four,five} = {numbers}
